# Fixed Categories Section - All Services Page

## Issue Resolution
**Problem**: The categories section under the search bar was not displaying properly on the All Services page.

**Root Cause**: The Chakra UI v3 Tabs component was not rendering correctly due to API changes or styling conflicts.

**Solution**: Replaced the Tabs component with a more reliable Button-based category filter system.

## New Categories Section Features

### **Visual Design**
- **Professional Container**: Light gray background with subtle border
- **Clear Header**: "Browse by Category:" label
